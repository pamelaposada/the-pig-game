<h3>Project Description</h3>
Small JavaScript game called The Pig Game.

<h3>Game Instructions </h3>

Each turn, the player repeatedly rolls the dice (ROLL DICE button) until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold (HOLD button).

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their CURRENT score and the player's turn continues.

If a player chooses to hold (HOLD button), their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
